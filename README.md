# Schedules App
**Project under active development**

Create and view schedules in a web app.

The app is available at:

The newest code here is not available at this link. Only the latest stable(ish) release is public.

All data is stored in my Google Drive. Code is run in Google Apps Script.

**Note: I can see any data in your schedules, your email, and password.**

You may create your own GAS (Google Apps Script) project with the latest code here to test it.
