# Schedules App
**Project under active development**

Create and view schedules in a web app. 

Report any bugs you find and tell me what to see on the [issues](https://github.com/UplandJacob2/Schedules-App/issues) page

The app is available at:

The newest code here is not available at this link. Only the latest stable(ish) release is public.

All data is stored in my Google Drive. The code is run in Google Apps Script.

**Note: I can see any data in your schedules, your email, and password.**

Bugs are bound to be plentiful, so report them.
